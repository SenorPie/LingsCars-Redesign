# LingsCars-Redesign
### Description
My professor wanted me to remake a terrible website on the internet, this is what I came up with.

### Plans for the project
- [x] Find a website
- [x] Make a graphic profile 
- [x] Make a redesign/sketch of the website
- [ ] Turn this redesign into actual code (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Create a backend using Flask RESTAPI and have a payment solution with this.

### Architecture which will be in use
Frontend architecture: Only HTML5, CSS and a bit of js **(No framework in use)**

Backend architecture: Flask RESTAPI with a SQL database (haven't chosen one yet)
